We cannot pass array into function argument
Only four kind of types handled. int,int*,char and char*
The global variables are simply the functions declared outside.
It is assumed in continuity with previous assignments that global variables are to be ignored
There are many changes made in .y and .cxx file of previous assignments to incorporate the many challenges faced in this assignment
Thse changes include making some changes in function declaration and calling, array offset calculation, and return value handling.
It is assumed that user would compulsarily add appropriate return value at the end of function specification.
All the test files are given in test files folder and also in current folder.
New Functions introduced

void symbolTable::createMemoryBinding()
void Quad::printAssembly(int index)

typedef struct label
{
	int quadindex;
	string name;
}label;

label findLabel(int index);
label addLabel(int index);
bool  isLabel(int index);


void createLabelTable(vector<Quad*> v);
void printLabelTable();
void createStringLabel();

bool checkStringIsInt(string s);
int convertToInt(string s);

//Create the external function libraries.
void createExternalTable();

Some new global Variables were also declared. You can see them in global Variables.c file

All of them are explained in .cxx file


As all the new functions are extension of existing Classes, hence I have defined them in translator file only instead of making a separate file. You can find all of them in 12CS10034_ass6_translator.cxx
